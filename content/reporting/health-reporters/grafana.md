Health check results can be visualised with Grafana by [reporting health check results as metrics]({{< ref "reporting/health-reporters/metrics.md" >}}). Grafana also supports [annotations](http://docs.grafana.org/reference/annotations/), whereby points can be marked on a graph with event descriptions.
